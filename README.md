## Introduction
This web page mainly introduces my 4 course projects related to different statistical models. All the projects consist of exploratory data analysis, model building and hypothesis testing. The analysis is conducted via R software.  

* ***Effect of Class Size on Student Achievement*** (One-way ANOVA Model)
* ***Relationship between a mandatory jail sentence and traffic fatalities*** (Time and Entity Fixed Effects Regression Model)
* ***Further Research on the Effect of Class Size on Student Achievement*** (Two-Way ANOVA Model)
* ***Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction*** (Logistic Regression Model & Random Forest)

## Methodology & Details 
### Project 1
In this project, we examine the effect of class size on math scores in grade 1 using data from the Tennessee STAR experiment. The project randomized students within a school into one of three class types: small (13-17 students per class), regular without a teacher’s aide (22-25 students), and regular with an aide (22-25 students). We conduct F-test within the ANOVA model to make inferences about whether the effects of three class types are different or not.
